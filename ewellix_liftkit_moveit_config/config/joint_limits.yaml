# joint_limits.yaml allows the dynamics properties specified in the URDF to be overwritten or augmented as needed
# Specific joint properties can be changed with the keys [max_position, min_position, max_velocity, max_acceleration]
# Joint limits can be turned off with [has_velocity_limits, has_acceleration_limits]

# As MoveIt! does not support jerk limits, the acceleration limits provided here are the highest values that guarantee
# that no jerk limits will be violated. More precisely, applying Euler differentiation in the worst case (from min accel
# to max accel in 1 ms) the acceleration limits are the ones that satisfy
# max_jerk = (max_acceleration - min_acceleration) / 0.001
